Just demo of Jekyll

* * *

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```csharp
public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        System.Console.WriteLine("hello jekyll!");
    }
}
// Prints "hello jekyll!" to console
```
